# Application Progress

# Week 1

We came up with some great ideas about how to leverage the power of the crime data we are collecting. We are now developing a new mobile application in Xamarin technology, and we call it [TravelSafe](Projects/HackatonProject1). The basic idea is to help people navigate safely around while they are traveling, visiting a restaurant, passing thru a neighborhood. The application will guide the users visually and verbally while they are en route. For instance, you are travelling to Salt Lake City and not very familiar with this area. As you drive, the application shows the roads which are safer in terms of criminal activities. It helps you choose safer streets to pass through for your final destination. You may also be looking for a restraunt to eat something. How do you decide where you and your family can have a nice meal with a peace of mind? TravelSafe will tell you exactly this, as well. For instance, if the criminal activity is gradually increasing in the parking lot of a restraunt you want to dine at, you will see this crucial and vital information before you even get near to that place. If you are sightseeing around the city, how do you know where to stop and enjoy the view and where to pass by? Check out TravelSafe and it will tell you in real time where you should not be stopping. We believe the social impact of this application will also be great. People, especially the business owners, will be more cognizant of their area not to lose customers. Therefore, they will more be inclined to install cameras and take actions to reduce the number of crimes around them. This will offload some of the work from the public safety agencies over to citizens. Such increasing demand will also help public safety companies get enough revenue and market size to innovate and come up with cheaper and more effective solutions to allow people to live in a more peaceful environment.
